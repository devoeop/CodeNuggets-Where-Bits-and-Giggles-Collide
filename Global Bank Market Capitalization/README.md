# Global Bank Market Capitalization Transformation Project

- Data engineering initiative for a multi-national firm, extracting, processing, and transforming market capitalization data of the top 10 banks worldwide.
- Developed functions utilizing Python and pandas to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data, incorporating exchange rates from a CSV file to present market capitalization in USD, GBP, EUR, and INR.
- Implemented SQL database interactions using SQLAlchemy to store and query the transformed data, providing country-specific market capitalization information for managers across offices.
