# Highway De-congestion Project
- Design and implementation of a comprehensive data engineering project aimed at alleviating traffic congestion on national highways.
- Used Apache Airflow to orchestrate a complex DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) for seamless data collection, extraction from diverse file formats (CSV, TSV, Fixed Width), consolidation, and transformation.
- Established a streaming data pipeline with Kafka, Zookeeper, and Python for real-time vehicle data collection from diverse toll plaza IT setups.
- Unified toll plaza data into a consolidated file, enhancing analytics and contributing to congestion management strategies.
