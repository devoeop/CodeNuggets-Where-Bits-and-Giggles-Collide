# Project Description
This project has four parts, each building on the previous one. 

In part one, I performed ETL activities, including loading the modified version of the NASA Airfoil Self Noise dataset, removing duplicate rows, dropping rows with null values, applying necessary transformations, and storing the cleaned data in the parquet format. 

Moving on to part two, I created a machine learning pipeline with three stages, including a regression stage. After training the model, I proceeded to part three to evaluate its performance using relevant metrics.

Finally, in part four, I persisted the model, allowing it to load and utilize it in real-world applications when predicting new data. As the final step, I verified the stored model to ensure its integrity and usability in future tasks or deployments.
